## Questions to be answered/ analysed:
1. What is the average spending per receipt?
2. What is the most frequently purchased item?
3. How does the price of this most frequently purchased item change over time?
4. Is there a difference in spending habits depending on the days of the week (weekdays/ weekends)?
5. Which categories do customers spend the most money on?

```{r}
setwd("data")
# all text files
text_files <- list.files(pattern = "\\.txt$")

file_contents <- list()

#read in each text file
for (file in text_files) {
  file_contents[[file]] <- readLines(file)
}

# access the contents of the first file
print(file_contents[[1]])

```
